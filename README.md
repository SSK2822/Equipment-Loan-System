# Equipment Loan System
 
This repository consists of the assignment of course CS2312 at City University of Hong Kong. The assignemnt uses some of the best practices of OOPs for solving the problem set using Java as the primary source language. This project gave me more insghts on OOPs and Java frameworks. I also learnt the importance of good coding practices.
VS Code was the primary IDE for the assignment.
